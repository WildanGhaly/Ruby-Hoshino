# Interpolation Polynomial

Welcome to the Interpolation Polynomial repository! This project offers a versatile script designed to facilitate data interpolation through the utilization of a polynomial fitting method. The script is founded upon the renowned [Lagrange Polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial) technique, a specific form of [polynomial interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation) that enables the estimation of values between known data points.

## Introduction

Interpolation stands as a fundamental technique in the field of numerical analysis, bridging the gap between discrete sets of data points and enabling the derivation of values that lie within the existing data range. This process is essential for numerous applications, including scientific research, engineering, computer graphics, and data visualization.

The Lagrange Polynomial method employed by this script is particularly valuable due to its simplicity and applicability. By constructing a polynomial that passes through each of the given data points, this method generates a flexible curve that can smoothly interpolate new data points. This curve retains the shape of the original data distribution, enabling accurate approximations and predictions within the data range.


## Supported Languages

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the folder of your desired programming language.
3. Read the `README` file in that folder for instructions on how to run the script.
4. Use the provided code to perform interpolation using the Lagrange Polynomial method.

## Directory Structure

Each language folder contains the following:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the interpolation script.
- `doc/`: Contains example input and output files to help you understand the input format and expected results.
- `test/`: Contains unit tests for the interpolation script.`:
